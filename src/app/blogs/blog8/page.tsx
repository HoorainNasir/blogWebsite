          <h1 id="1">What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
          <br />

          <p>
            Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing
            services—including servers, storage, databases, networking,
            software, and analytics—over the internet (&334;the cloud&334;). Instead of
            relying on local servers or personal devices, these services are
            accessed remotely, providing scalability, flexibility, and
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In simple terms, cloud computing allows you to access and store data
            and applications on remote servers, meaning you don&#39;t have to worry
            about physical infrastructure. This offers significant advantages,
            especially for businesses and developers looking for robust,
            cost-effective solutions.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h1 id="2">Types of Cloud Computing</h1>
          <p>
            Cloud computing can be categorized based on how it is deployed and
            the services offered:
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>1. Deployment Modules:</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Public Cloud: </strong> Owned and operated by third-party
            providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google
            Cloud, these clouds offer services over the public internet. They
            are cost-effective, highly scalable, and ideal for startups and
            smaller organizations.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>Private Cloud: </strong> A private cloud is dedicated to a
            single organization, providing more control and security. It is
            often used by enterprises with specific regulatory or privacy needs.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>Hybird Cloud:</strong>A hybrid cloud combines both public
            and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between
            them. This approach provides the flexibility of the public cloud
            with the security of the private cloud.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>2. Service Models:</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong>
            This model provides fundamental computing resources such as virtual
            machines and storage. It allows businesses to avoid the costs of
            purchasing and managing physical servers. Example: Amazon EC2.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> PaaS offers a
            platform allowing developers to build, test, and deploy applications
            without managing the underlying infrastructure. Example: Google App
            Engine.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> SaaS delivers
            software applications
